#What's la Fabulosa?

The Republic of the Mountain manifested itself thanks to the social cataclysm of Chile in October 2019. The tectonic plates of the eternal transition released the energy accumulated for more than 500 years, since the invader stepped on this territory, distorting the dance of the bees , the course of rivers, the existence of wetlands. Since he began to destroy the sacred fields, to extract everything that could be sold; saltpeter, copper and gold, pollute the salt flats to extract lithium, to cover fertile land with mining tailings.

The Republic of the Mountain is constituted as a utopian micronation, decentralized and intangible, which activates an ephemeral appearance from the foothills of the Andes towards the limits of our perception. The Republic of the Mountain lies in the middle of the city and at the bottom of the sea. The presence of the mountain becomes a provocation to explore, to travel its unknown, unexplored territory, denied by the continuous distraction of the media. In the Fabulous Republic of the Mountain it is possible to put into practice the transformation of our form of collective action, something that the wise Mapuche people know as "Kume Mogen", or Good Living, inviting to live a form of balanced relationship between people and their environment, where the collective vertigo stops spinning as it was the end of a macabre dance.

In the Republic of the Mountain the well-being of all living beings lies in our ability as humans to sink a colonialist, alienating and destructive attitude, where the accumulation of capital configures a kind of collective insanity. Decrease, slow down, breathe. The Republic of the Mountain resides in our collective unconscious, and the way to access its territory is through meditation, the intonation of a common tune, in which we find our own memory, actions and experiences. In the Republic of the Mountain the ascent occurs inwards, the journey towards an absolute introspection, where the transformation manifests itself from the recognition of our liquid, mutant and mutable being, from the observation of the distance and perspective of the internal territory, where the conformation of a geography constituted by the intangibility of our memory.

The Republic of the Mountain is electromagnetic, noospheric, a body without organs where its inhabitants move as energy bodies without limits, merging with each other, in an eternal vibration, where energy and dark matter are the main source that structures its topology. In The Republic of the Mountain the vibrations of our existence bounce between the ravines of its volume, filter towards its center and turn us into itself.

In the mountain republic
We declare Mother Earth the great protector of all its inhabitants.
We seek the common good of all species.
We abandon our greed disguised as freedom.
We accept ourselves as a part and not as a whole.
We explore the harmonic contemplation of our environment.
We detect each cycle that surrounds us, large or small.
And we connect it to our own life cycle.
to flourish and collaborate.

Climate chgane is here. And we must act now. 
That's why we invite you to be a citizen of the Republic,
to use the power of your informed and conscious decisions.

The “We Tripantu” it’s the traditional new year’s celebration for Mapuche People, normally celebrated on June 24th, when the shortest day of winter is upon us. The winter solstice is the biggest celebration  for Mapuche communities, welcoming the return of the new sun and the new life. 
In that spirit of renovation “Chinchintirapié Carnival School” a Chilean based organization will be presenting a musical performance called “We tripantú and funeral procession” the show divided in 3 “coplas” that will be center in Birth, Life & Death. Will celebrate will celebrate life cycles with the powerful sounds of a “comparsa” that not only have a big array of musicians playing trumpets, trombones, clarinets, tubas, saxophones, and accordions; and exotic percussions such as the Chin chin(orchestra man), caja, güiro and plates, dancers,  and Masked characters in charge of protecting the troupe, opening the street, representing satire and criticism of the troupe, using different or giant puppets. We are sorry to say that brujos will not participate as traditions won’t allow them to appear on camera.  This mestizo street show invites you from the community carnival resistance to a travel through the natural cycles of Life and Death. With our ancestral roots, the band will take sounds and vibrations towards the cycles that do not end, but rather continue from the circular worldview in our territories and our relationship with the Sun. At the same time, our singers and dancers through voice will denounce and they will celebrate the transition; Their colorful opposition costumes will bring strength and energy from their bodies and expressions from our memory of people in struggle and mestizo resistance. While the figurines through the use of masks will give life, through different elements, to the symbolic and ritual memory that surround each of our assemblies, at the same time they will provide the necessary protection - both physical and spiritual.

What is freedom for you? For many, freedom is just a matter of doing “Whatever we want”. So we go around thinking that we are free; But blackmail starts from within as we get to cover our needs. We decide to study, to get a job so we can “Pay the bills”, but at the end of the day we give up our time for money. Now with that money we think that we can buy “Whatever we want” but now we don’t have our time, so rush into the supermarket to get our food, as it will be easier to get it from there, now big corporations also control what we eat. But the decisions that we make are given by the possibilities of our contexts, and for years we have the illusion of choice.
But what to do, can you live without a supermarket?
And at this crucial point, we need to step back, and look to the ground, to unlearn what we know and go back to grow our own food and one the most important things; To make it taste good.
Cooking for freedom comes from the experience of the pandemic and our farm, trying to live without buying from the supermarket, and the reflections that come with it.
It comes from the ability to adapt your diet, paying attention to your surroundings, and move forward with a different mindset. Join us in this open workshop with Maria Felices, a healthy cooking expert from Chile/Ecuador to chat about how to change our lifes starting from food.
